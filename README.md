# starter-template-frontend
Solito based starter template for Data Ecosytems

## Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- Expo SDK 48
- Next.js 13
- React Navigation 6

## 🗂 Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## 🏁 Start the app
